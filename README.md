##About the App

The app starts by asking the user to enter their name and enter a url link to a photo of them. This information will be stored in a link on the website "API Friends List". This will allow other users to match with users who submitted information before them. The program does this by asking the user to answer 10 questions about their interests and lifestlyes. The answers for the questions are ranked from 1 to 5, 1 being that the question is least like them or 5 if they strongly agree and feel that this question is much like them. Once they have filled out the survey they are matched with the person who has the most in common with them.
